				<p>Use the boxes below to indicate <strong>how much you think the other people in your group contribute</strong> in this round. Put the highest value in the box at the top and then rank the contributions in descending order. You can input the same value for multiple people. In that case the ordering for those people does not matter. We will rank the contribution of the other people in your group in this round and compare each of them to your respones. For every reponse that you estimate completely correctly you get {{ Constants.belief_correct_pay }}. This means that you can earn up a maximum of {{ max_ee_earning }}. The less accurate your response is the less points you receive. If your response differs from the true values by more than {{ Constants.belief_correct_pay }} then you receive 0.
