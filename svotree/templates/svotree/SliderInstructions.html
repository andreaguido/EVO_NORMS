		<h4>Instructions</h4>

			<p>You have been randomly paired with another person, whom we will refer to as <strong>the other</strong>. This other person is someone you do not know. Both of you will remain mutually anonymous and all of your choices are completely confidential.</p>
		
			<p>You will be making a series of decisions about allocating resources between you and this other person. For each of the following questions, please indicate the distribution you prefer most by <strong>moving the slider along the scale to your preferred payoff allocation</strong>. You can only make one selection for each decision.</p>

			<p>Your decisions will yield money for both yourself and the other person. In the example below, a person has chosen to distribute money so that he/she receives 50 points, while the anonymous other person receives 40 points.</p>

			<p>There are no right or wrong answers, this is all about personal preferences. After you have made your decision, <strong>make it final by pressing the Confirm button to the right of the scale.</strong> As you can see, your choices will influence both the amount of points you receive and the amount of points the other receives. When you have made all your decisions, <strong>press the 'Next' button at the bottom of the screen</strong> to complete this decision stage.</p>

			<p>At the end of the experiment, one person from each pair will be randomly chosen, and one of the decisions that this person made will be applied. This will determine the earnings you both receive in this stage. In other words, if you are selected, then one of your choices will determine the payoff that both you and the other person receive. If you are not selected, then a randomly selected choice made by the other person will be implemented, and your earnings will depend on the choice he/she made about the distribution of resources. The selection will be at random, and neither of you will know beforehand whose decision will be applied.</p>
